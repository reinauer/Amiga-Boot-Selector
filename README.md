# Amiga Boot Selector

This is a Floppy Switcher for the Amiga 500/2000. It allows you to
switch DF0/DF1, making it possible to boot from either a Gotek drive
or the internal floppy drive. without relying on AmigaOS.

## About

This work is a derivative of the [Amiga Boot Selector by
Jussi Kilpeläinen](https://jussikilpelainen.kapsi.fi/wordpress/?p=256)

This redesign puts the pin header for the switch to the side, reducing
the footprint of the adapter. The project was mainly born out of the fact
that I could not buy a ready-made version of a boot selector in the US
(several European sellers bailed out on me)

Since I had to order my own PCBs anyway, I decided to optimize the design
a bit for my use case.
